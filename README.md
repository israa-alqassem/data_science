## Data Science
This repository contains various data science assignments and projects which I enjoyed working on.
* In `./car_listings` there are a classification and regression problems
  * Predict product tier class (i.e., Basic, Premium, Plus) using RandomForestClassifier
  * Predict detail views using GradientBoostingRegressor
* In `./lstm_seq2seq`, there is an example of a character-level recurrent sequence-to-sequence model for translating short English sentences to French, using Keras and ran on a GPU machine, GeForce RTX 2080.
