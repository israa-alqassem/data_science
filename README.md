## Data Science
This repository contains various data science assignments and projects which I enjoyed solving/working on.
* In `./car_listings` there are a classification and regression problems
  * Predict product tier class (i.e., Basic, Premium, Plus) using Random Forest Classifier
  * Predict detail views using Gradient Boosting Regressor
* In `./lstm_seq2seq`, there is an example of a character-level recurrent sequence-to-sequence model for translating short English sentences to French, using TensorFlow v2.2.0 and Keras v2.3.0 and ran on a GPU machine, GeForce RTX 2080.
* In `./restaurant_reviews`, I coded a simple solution for NLP classification task, the goal is to predict whether a customer's review is positive or negative, currently I'm using Rndom Forest Classifier, but I'll update the solution to include ensemble of different classifiers.
